# hydradb
A multi-model, scalable database written in Go

## Goals
- [ ] Support for relational data
- [ ] Support for document models
- [ ] Support for graph-based nodes and relations
- [ ] ACID compliant transactions

## Good to have
- [ ] **Cryptographic verifiability**. I really like how Amazon QLDB lets you verify the state of the database since the last verified transaction.
- [ ] Horizontal scalability
- [ ] **Realtime queries**. RethinkDB FTW!

## Why another database?
I'm bored, and I suffer from the engineer's itch.

##  What's next?
I have absolutely no idea.
